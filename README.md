# Dijkstra Vaccine Graph (CS220 Project)

## Objective
 - Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the fastest 
   route from the source vertex to all other vertices.
   Requires a file input to create a graph from such 
   with the source node defaulting to that at the zero 
   index of the vertex list.
     
## Usage
  - Upon running main, user is prompted with an
  input for a filename with the corresponding layout
  located in this project's rubric. Upon submitting a
  valid filename, the program will run and output a list
  of all other nodes and the corresponding distance from
  the source node
